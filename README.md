# Course Project

## Aim
The aim of the course project is to give you an opportunity to synthesize topics you have learned during the Object-oriented Programming Course into a single system embedded in a real-world engineering challenge. You should have already selected a topic for your project. There are three deliverables: (1) functioning program, (2) report, and (3) self-assessment. You should study the provided evaluation scheme to understand how your work will be assessed.

## Assessment
1.	__Program (15 points)__: your program should be implemented to solve in a simplistic way your chosen project topic. It should not need to be overly complicated, but it should demonstrate optimizations for speed and memory, as well as object-oriented programming paradigms. The code should be readable, with a clear output to the console.
    - __Upload your code files directly to the _code/_ directory in this repository. The code should run straight from Github codespaces.__

2.	__Report (18 points)__: your report should provide an educated reader with enough information to understand the challenge your program attempts to solve, how your program is structured, and the reason behind the decisions you made. 
    - You should structure your report with headings/sub-headings that include an “introduction”, your “approach”, and your “solution”. 
    - You should also include a diagram (high-level flowchart or UML diagram) that defines how your program is structured (e.g. using [draw.io](draw.io)). 
    - You should also highlight implementation of optimizations and object-oriented paradigms through the use of code snippets (do no copy and paste large sections of code). 
    - A length of 3 to 6 pages in single-spaced 12pt font is reasonable for a report. Please do not plagiarize.
    - __Upload your report in Markdown format to this repository in the `Report.md` file .__

3.	__Self-assessment (2 points)__: you should study and submit the evaluation scheme below along with your report. It defines how you will be evaluated and what constitutes excellent work.

## Self-assessment (2 points)
To ensure you understand the requirements of the project, a checklist in (a) provides a summary of what you should understand and submit. 

### (a) Check-list
Check the list below as they are completed using the [x] symbol.
- [ ] Read this document.
- [ ] Understand the evaluation scheme.
- [ ] Submit code files into this repo under the __code/__ directory.
- [ ] Ensure code files can be executed in a Github codespace environment.
- [ ] Provide a screenshot of your code's output.
- [ ] Submit your report in `Report.md`.
- [ ] Complete the self-assessment according to the defined evaluation scheme.
  - [ ] Complete the self-assessment table (b) below.
